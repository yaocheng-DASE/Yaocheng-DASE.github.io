Dr. Yao Cheng is currently an Assistant Professor with the Department of Data and Systems Engineering (previously named Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering) [official website](https://www.dase.hku.hk/people/y-cheng), at The University of Hong Kong (HKU). Her research aims to assess and optimize the performance of complex systems by addressing their inherent failures and external hazards. To this end, she focuses on two interrelated areas: reliability engineering and resilience engineering, by developing innovative methodologies for reliability modelling, reliability testing, maintenance policy design, and resilience modelling and optimization.

Since joined HKU in 2018, Dr. Cheng has published 24 peer-reviewed papers in top and flagship journals in reliability engineering and industrial engineering (with 21 as first/corresponding author, and 5 more under revision), such as IISE Transactions,
Technometrics, <em>Naval Research Logistics<em>, <em>Reliability Engineering & System Safety<em>, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering, IEEE Transactions on Reliability, Transportation Science, and International Journal of Production Research. Dr. Cheng has been awarded 3 General Research Fund (GRF) and 1 Early Career Scheme (ECS) grants from the Research Grant Council of Hong Kong, respectively. She has also successfully implemented her research in the industry through contract-based research. Dr. Cheng is currently an Editorial Board Member of the International Journal of Reliability, Quality and Safety Engineering, and served as a guest editor for several academic journals. 

Dr. Cheng is also passionate about teaching. Her teaching innovations have led to an HKU Teaching Development Grant (TDG) and a Faculty Outstanding Teaching Award (team award). She has successfully graduated 3 Ph.D. students, 2 of whom have been taking faculty positions in academic institutes.
